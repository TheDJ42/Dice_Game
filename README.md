This is a basic Dice Game written in C-Sharp.
To compile it in Windows, use MSbuild. Or Visual Studio.
However if you want to compile in osX or Linux, good luck.
The Object of this game is to get as high a score as possible. 
At the beginning of every round all four dice are randomly rolled.
You may re-roll any dice, but you only get six re-rolls per round, so roll wisely!
At the end of every round, the total round score is added to the total score, but if all four dice have the same value, your total score multiplies by five!
